# Job shop scheduling problem. 

The job shop scheduling may be sketched as follows: 

> We are given $n$ jobs, each composed of several operations, 
> that must be processed on $m$ machines. Each operation uses 
> one of the $m$ machines for a fixed duration. 

The problem is to find a schedule of the operations on the machines, 
such that the make span $C_{\text{max}}$ is minimized, that is, 
the finish time of the last operation completed in the schedule.
